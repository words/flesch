/**
 * Given an object containing the number of words (`word`), the number of sentences (`sentence`), and the number of syllables  (`syllable`) in a document, returns the reading ease associated with the document.
 *
 * Returned values are 120 (every sentence consisting of only two one-syllable words), or lower (including negative values).
 *
 * The values have the following semantics:
 *
 * |     Score    | Semantics                                           |
 * | :----------: | :-------------------------------------------------- |
 * | 90.0 – 100.0 | Easily understood by an average 11-year-old student |
 * |  60.0 – 70.0 | Easily understood by 13- to 15-year-old students    |
 * |  0.0 – 30.0  | Best understood by university graduates             |
 *
 * Therefore we can use the following formula to approximate the average age a student would understand a document at, given score `score`:
 *
 * ```js
 * var age = 20 - Math.floor(score / 10)
 * ```
 *
 * @param {FleschCounts} counts
 * @returns {number}
